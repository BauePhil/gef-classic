<h2>1. <a name="Target Operating Environments"></a> Target Platforms</h2>

<p>GEF 3.0 requires the Eclipse 3.0 Rich Client Platform and the optional <b> <code>org.eclipse.ui.views</code></b> 
plug-in.&nbsp;
See the Eclipse Platform readme for requirements of the Eclipse
platform.</p>

<p>GEF 3.0.x has been tested and validated on the following Java 2
Platform implementations:</p>

<h2>2. <a name="Compatibility with Previous Release"></a> Compatibility with Previous Release</h2>

<p><b>API Contract Compatibility:</b> GEF 3.0 is upwards
contract-compatible with GEF 2.1 except where the Eclipse Platform .&nbsp; Downward contract compatibility
is not supported. There is no guarantee that compliance with 3.0
APIs would ensure compliance with 2.1 APIs. Refer to <i><a href="http://eclipse.org/eclipse/development/java-api-evolution.html">Evolving
Java-based APIs</a></i> for a discussion of the kinds of API changes that
maintain contract compatibility.</p>
<p><b>Binary (plug-in) Compatibility:</b> GEF 3.0 is upwards
binary-compatible with GEF 2.1 except in those areas noted in
the <em>Eclipse
3.0 Plug-in Migration Guide</em>. Eclipse 3.0 will include additional runtime
compatibility mechanisms to provide effective binary API compatibility. Downward
plug-in compatibility is not supported. Plug-ins for Eclipse SDK 3.0 will not be
usable in Eclipse SDK 2.0 or 2.1. Refer to <i><a href="http://eclipse.org/eclipse/development/java-api-evolution.html">Evolving
Java-based APIs</a></i> for a discussion of the kinds of API changes that
maintain binary compatibility.
<p><b>Non-compliant usage of API's</b>: All non-API methods and classes, and
everything in a package with &quot;internal&quot; in its name, are
considered implementation details which may vary between operating environment
and are subject to change without notice. Client plug-ins that directly depend
on anything other than what is specified in the API are inherently
unsupportable and receive no guarantees about compatibility within a single
release or across releases. Refer to <i><a href="http://www.eclipse.org/articles/Article-API%20use/eclipse-api-usage-rules.html">How
to Use the Eclipse API</a></i> for information about how to write compliant
plug-ins.&nbsp; </p>
<h2>3. <a name="Known Issues"></a> Known Issues</h2>
<h4>Win32 - Printing</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>Some fonts scale differently on the printer than they do on the
screen. This may result in printed text appearing wider than the
same text on the screen. This is only a problem with certain
vector fonts.</p>
<p>Images with transparency masks may print incorrectly. This is a
limitation in SWT, which GEF uses for printing.</p>
<p>Printing is not implemented on some SWT platforms.</p>
